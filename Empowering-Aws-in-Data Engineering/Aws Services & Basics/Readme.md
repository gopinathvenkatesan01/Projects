### The Data Engineering Using _`AWS Services`_ In Data Pipelines with 5V's of Data:


1. __AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service):__ Object storage service for storing and retrieving large amounts of data.
2. __AWS Redshift:__ Fully managed data warehousing service for analytics and reporting. It is optimized for online analytical processing (OLAP) workloads.
3. __AWS Athena:__ Interactive query service that allows you to analyze data stored in Amazon S3 using standard SQL queries.
4. __AWS Lambda:__ Serverless compute service that allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers. It can be used to build serverless ETL pipelines.
5. __AWS Event Bridge:__ Used to trigger an event based on the services that need to be triggered in a sequential manner and for scheduling.
6. __AWS Data Pipeline:__ Orchestration service that allows you to schedule and automate the movement and transformation of data between different AWS services and on-premises data sources.
7. __AWS Glue:__ Fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy to prepare and load data for analytics.
8. __AWS Glue DataBrew:__ Visual data preparation tool that helps you clean and normalize data for analytics.
9. __AWS Glue Data Catalog:__ Central metadata repository that stores metadata information about data sources, transformations, and targets.
10. __AWS Glue Schema Registry:__ Service for managing schemas and enabling schema evolution for data lakes.
11. __AWS EMR (Elastic MapReduce):__ Managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks like Apache Hadoop, Spark, and Presto for processing large-scale data.
12. __AWS Kinesis:__ Real-time streaming data platform that allows you to collect, process, and analyze streaming data from various sources.
13. __AWS DynamoDB:__ Fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and flexible document and key-value storage.
14. __AWS Quicksight:__ Business intelligence (BI) service that enables you to create interactive dashboards and perform ad hoc analysis on your data.
15. __AWS Step Functions:__ Serverless workflow service that enables you to coordinate multiple AWS services and build complex data processing pipelines.
16. __AWS CloudFormation:__ Infrastructure as code service that enables you to define and provision AWS resources using JSON or YAML templates.
17. __AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management):__ Service for managing user access and permissions to AWS resources.
18. __AWS CloudWatch:__ Monitoring and observability service that provides insights into your AWS resources and applications.
19. __AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) and AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS):__ Messaging services for event-driven architectures and decoupled communication between components.
