<h1 align="center"> Bulk & Near Real-Time Data Processing Pipelines </h1>

<h3> Descriptions:</h3>

1. Generally There are `two` types of Pipelines used in _Data Processing_

    - `Batch Processing`
    - `Real-time Processing`

2. [**`Bulk Processing`**](https://github.com/pnraj/Projects/tree/master/AWS%3A%20Bulk%20%26%20Near%20Real-Time%20Pipelines/Spark-Enabled%20Extraction%20and%20Loading%20Into%20AWS%20RDS) is type of Batch Processing which is used when data is not processed in schedule or time intervales but volume of data is high and needed to get processed but not in scheduled manner.

3. [**`Near real-time processing`**](https://github.com/pnraj/Projects/tree/master/AWS%3A%20Bulk%20%26%20Near%20Real-Time%20Pipelines/API%20TO%20RDS%20USING%20LAMBDA%20WITH%20SLACK%20ERROR%20MONITORING) is type of real time processing but the interval which it is processed will have latency of seconds, in this project the data is processed in **`15 seconds`** interval so it called near real-time processing
