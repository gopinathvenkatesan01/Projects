<h1 align="center"> Bulk & Near Real-Time Data Processing Pipelines </h1>

<h3> Descriptions:</h3>

1. Generally There are `two` types of Pipelines used in _Data Processing_

    - `Batch Processing`
    - `Real-time Processing`

2. [**`Bulk Processing`**](https://github.com/pnraj/Projects/tree/master/AWS%3A%20Bulk%20%26%20Near%20Real-Time%20Pipelines/Spark-Enabled%20Extraction%20and%20Loading%20Into%20AWS%20RDS) is a type of Batch Processing used when data is not processed at scheduled time intervals. Instead, it involves processing a high volume of data without a specific schedule..

3. [**`Near real-time processing`**](https://github.com/pnraj/Projects/tree/master/AWS%3A%20Bulk%20%26%20Near%20Real-Time%20Pipelines/API%20TO%20RDS%20USING%20LAMBDA%20WITH%20SLACK%20ERROR%20MONITORING) is a type of data processing that resembles real-time processing, but with a slight delay of usually a few seconds before the data is processed. In the context of this project, the data is processed at regular intervals of _**15 seconds**_, which qualifies it as near real-time processing.
